# bookList
Basic book entry database that has two different JavaScript files - one uses ES5 constructors and the other uses ES6 classes; while the overall the effect is the same, this project is a chance to demonstrate the difference in writing each one.  

Additionally, the appES6.js includes functionality for user entries to save to and remove from the book list.  Currently, the HTML file is set to be using the appES6.js file.
